# Road Network Redesign with Linear Programming

## Introduction

Consider the problem "maximizing network connectivity subjected to various feasibility constraints", we apply linear programming as the solution
method. In this project, we provide a simple example to demonstrate the viability of this approach, and discuss possible extensions of the algorithms to accommodate more complicated cases.
